Projects: 
RemoteDesktopClient
RemoteDesktopServer

Client project simulates sending and receiving screen image for 20 seconds. Client A asks client B to share screen then client B sends back the screen images to client A
Server project contains server functions. it keeps the connected users and transfers requests between clients.

Notes: I used the same RemoteDesktop.proto in two projects for simpilicity
